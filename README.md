Open-source Software --> Decentralized Tech

## The Revolution Will NOT Be Televised..
This repo holds the [source]() code for the enabling tech behind the decentralized technology ventures of [amabio](). Although this code is open-source, the compiled version has been utilized to enable a [commercial venture]() which is [protected by a patent](). This code is generally useful to the public, so we thought it immoral to keep private.
