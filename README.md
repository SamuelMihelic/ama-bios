Open-source Software --> Decentralized Tech

## The Revolution Will NOT Be Televised..
This repo holds the [source]() code for the enabling tech behind the decentralized technology ventures of [amabio](https://www.amabio.tech/). Although this code is open-source, the compiled version has been utilized to enable a [commercial venture](link_to_commercial) which is [protected by a patent](link_to_patent). This code is generally useful to the public, so we thought it immoral to keep private.
